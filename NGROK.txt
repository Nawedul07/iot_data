NGROK 

üîç What Is Ngrok?
Ngrok is a secure tunneling tool that exposes local servers to the internet through public URLs (e.g., abc123.ngrok.io). It is especially useful for:

Testing webhooks or APIs on local servers

Sharing local development sites

Allowing remote devices to access locally hosted apps

Ngrok forwards traffic from a public endpoint to your localhost on a specified port.

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Risks of Using Ngrok
Ngrok by itself is not a vulnerability. However, if misconfigured, it can open severe attack vectors, including ransomware attacks. Here are the primary risks:

1. Public Exposure Without Authentication
If your local service (especially REST APIs, admin dashboards, etc.) is exposed via ngrok without authentication or CORS control, anyone with the ngrok URL can:

Access sensitive APIs

Trigger destructive commands (e.g., delete, reset, format)

Run script injections on poorly secured endpoints

2. Revealing Sensitive Data
If your frontend is exposed and makes unauthenticated API calls (e.g., MongoDB ops, user login routes, internal sensors), attackers can:

Intercept or fuzz endpoints

Exfiltrate data (e.g., sensor readings, database entries)

Use that data for targeted attacks

3. Ransomware via Open File Systems or Exec APIs
If your backend allows:

File uploads to open directories

Command execution (like child_process in Node.js)
Attackers can upload ransomware payloads and execute them via exposed endpoints.

4. Phishing or Malware Hosting
Attackers can expose malicious websites or fake login pages using ngrok (common in phishing kits). Victims see a legit-looking URL like mybank.ngrok.io.

üõ°Ô∏è How to Secure Ngrok Usage
To prevent ransomware or similar attacks while using Ngrok, follow these best practices:

‚úÖ 1. Restrict allowedHosts in Frontend (Vite / Webpack)
Add the ngrok domain to your Vite config:

js
Copy
Edit
// vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    allowedHosts: ['your-subdomain.ngrok-free.app']
  }
})
‚úÖ 2. Implement Authentication
Always use authentication middleware (e.g., JWT, OAuth, API keys) in your Express routes:

js
Copy
Edit
app.use('/api', authMiddleware, apiRouter);
Don‚Äôt expose raw APIs without a gatekeeper.

‚úÖ 3. Limit Access with Ngrok Basic Auth
In your ngrok.yml config:

yaml
Copy
Edit
tunnels:
  telemetry-ui:
    addr: 5173
    proto: http
    basic_auth: username:password
Run with:

bash
Copy
Edit
ngrok start --all
This ensures only people with credentials can access your exposed app.

‚úÖ 4. Whitelist IPs (Pro plan)
If you have a paid plan, you can limit IP addresses that can access the tunnel.

‚úÖ 5. Monitor Traffic
Use:

Ngrok‚Äôs dashboard (https://dashboard.ngrok.com)

Logging tools (morgan, winston) on your backend

This helps detect unexpected traffic or suspicious patterns.

‚úÖ 6. Disable Dangerous Endpoints
Avoid endpoints that:

Run shell commands (child_process, exec)

Modify or delete files

Restart your server or system

‚úÖ 7. Rotate URLs Frequently
Ngrok free plan gives you random subdomains (e.g., abc123.ngrok.io) on each run. This adds a bit of obscurity. But if using a reserved domain, rotate or secure it heavily.

üß† Summary
Risk	Attack Vector	Mitigation
Unauthenticated access	Public APIs	Add JWT/Auth
Ransomware	File upload + exec	Disable unsafe endpoints
Phishing	Hosting fake frontend	Don‚Äôt expose login UIs
Data leaks	No CORS / open Mongo	Add CORS + sanitize
